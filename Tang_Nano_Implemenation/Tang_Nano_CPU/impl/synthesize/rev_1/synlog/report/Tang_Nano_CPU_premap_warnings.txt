@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"d:\libraries\documents\fpga\fpga\tang_nano_implemenation\tang_nano_cpu\src\reg.vhd":15:4:15:5|Found inferred clock CPU|clk which controls 45 sequential elements including Jump_Buffer.q[7]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
